I have been working as a software engineer for about 14 years now. I started my career as a web developer with php language about 9 years ago but my last 7 years are mostly involved with javascript frameworks and libraries like react.js angular and vuejs also nodejs and so on.
You know soft engineering is so much more than coding and I need to focus on different things like high level design and low level design, also creating blue prints and so on.
I love to contribute those kinds of works while working on projects.
I am familiar with angualr and while working with angular, I am familiar with angular js and angular both of them.
When we are talking about angular, angularjs means angular 1.x and angular means angular version 2 and more.
I am familar with with all of them and I was able to complete more than 20 small and large projects with enterprise solutions.
As a software engineer, I must be familiar with different services and tools, for the version controlling system, I am familiar with Github, BitBucket, Gitlab, Svn repositories, and also Microsoft Team services.
For the ticket management tools, I am familiar with Jira, Trello, active collab, Asana and you know there are many other services that we can use for the TMS purpose.
One of the most important things for the developers is testing. I am comfortable with unit testing, e2e testing of course automatic or the manual.
I can support more than 85% of code coverage for the codebase and cover the entire flow with e2e testing cases.
As a full stack developer, I am familiar with different backend frameworks and libraries,
I am familiar with expressjs and sailsjs  and node js.
For the Python language, I am comfortable with the django framework and also I have about 3 year of experience with Ruby on Rails as well.
For the database, personally I would like to use PostgreSQL for most of projects, I like it a lot.
Regarding my availablity, I can commit more than 40 ~ 50 hours a wekk, and I can commit at the weekend if needed.
I am an individual freelancer and I am flexible at working hours, I can be online any timezone and I will make more than 4~5 hours of overlapping time with you or other developers so we can keep communication clearly without any issues.
That's the brief information about me. please let me know if you have any questions and I will be happy for trying to answer all of your technical and untechnical questions
